Project to deconstruct an existing project and rebuild. Intended to build proficiency in use of developer tools.

Completed project with homepage reconstructed visually but not a working example.

Took 2 attempts after over-complicating the first attempt by referring to Developer Tools to inspect actual Google page and copy/paste to try get identical look.

Second attempt used Google to search for help - kept the source code much simpler this way.

Happy with overall look although there are still small differences - Logo size (image used had less weight in font), "Sign In" button is also not perfect (had some difficulty with centering font in the button), footer also rises above logo if developer tools opened so it sits above the tool window.
